# Meteors

A clone of the 1979 arcade game **Asteroids** by Atari, written in Go.

This is the first game I wrote in Go, following [“Making Games in Go for Absolute Beginners”](https://threedots.tech/post/making-games-in-go/) by Miłosz Smółka.

After completing the tutorial, I made some enhancements. It's simple but playable — so have fun!
